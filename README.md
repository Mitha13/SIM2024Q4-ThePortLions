Instructions:
  - In MySQL, manually run user_management.sql, car_database.sql, shortlist_database.sql and buyerreview_database.sql to create their respective databases and tables.
  - Clone repo into htdocs if using xampp.

UPDATE 05-11-24:
  - Added relevant .sql files for db creation
  - Added a delete all .sql file *Only used if needed*

UPDATE 04-11-24:
  - Merged user management with car management
  - Every user type (admin, agent, buyer, seller) now has their own dashboard and respective pages that only their roles can access.
  - If upon running got some database issue, probably in 'db.php', the username or password needs to be re-adjusted to current system.
